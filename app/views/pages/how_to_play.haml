    <h1>Object of the game</h1><br>
    <br>
    The object of Rahtzee is to obtain the highest score from throwing 5
    dice.<br>
    The game consists of 13 rounds. In each round, you roll the dice and
    then score the roll in one of 13 categories. You must score once in
    each category. The score is determined by a different rule for each
    category.<br>
    The game ends once all 13 categories have been scored.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Game
    Start</span><br>
    <br>
    To start with, roll all the dice. After rolling you can either score
    the current roll (see below), or re-roll any or all of the dice.<br>
    <br>
    You may only roll the dice a total of 3 times. After rolling 3 times
    you must choose a category to score.<br>
    <br>
    You may score the dice at any point in the round, i.e. it doesn't have
    to be after the 3rd roll.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Scoring</span><br>
    <br>
    To score your combination of 5 dice, you click one of the 13 boxes, or
    write it on the scorecard (scoresheet). There are two sections to the
    score table - the Upper Section and the Lower Section.<br>
    <br>
    Once a box has been scored, it cannot be scored again for the rest of
    the game (except the Rahtzee category), so choose wisely.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Upper
    Section Scoring</span><br>
    <br>
    If you score in the upper section of the table, your score is the total
    of the specified die face.<br>
    So if you roll:<br>
    5 - 2 - 5 - 6 - 5 and score in the Fives category, your total for the
    category would be 15, because there are three fives, which are added
    together.<br>
    If the One, Three or Four Categories were selected for scoring with
    this roll, you would score a zero.<br>
    If placed in the Two or Six category, you would score 2 and 6
    respectively.<br>
    <br>
    Bonus If the total of Upper scores is 63 or more, add a bonus of 35.
    Note that 63 is the total of three each of 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s and 6s.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Lower
    Section Scoring</span><br>
    <br>
    In the lower scores, you score either a set amount, or zero if you
    don't satisfy the category requirements.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">3 and 4 of
    a kind</span>
    For 3 of a kind you must have at least 3 of the same die faces. You
    score the total of all the dice. For 4 of a kind you would need 4 die
    faces the same.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Small and
    Large Straight</span>
    A Straight is a sequence of consecutive die faces, where a small
    straight is 4 consecutive faces, and a large straight 5 consecutive
    faces.<br>
    Small straights score 30 and a large 40 points.<br>
    So if you rolled:<br>
    2 - 3 - 2 - 5 - 4<br>
    you could score 30 in small straight or 0 in large straight.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Full House</span>
    A
    Full House is where you have 3 of a kind and 2 of a kind. Full houses
    score 25 points.<br>
    i.e.:<br>
    3 - 3 - 2 - 3 - 2<br>
    would score 25 in the Full House category.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chance</span>
    You can
    roll anything and be able to put it in the Chance category. You score
    the total of the die faces.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
    Rahtzee</span> A
    Rahtzee is 5 of a kind and scores 50 points, although you may elect NOT
    to score it as a Rahtzee, instead choosing to take it as a top row
    score and safegaurd you bonus.<br>
